# LED-Display

This project demonstrates how to interface a 16x2 LCD display with an Arduino Uno to display text messages.

**Components Used**

Arduino Uno – The microcontroller used to control the LCD.

16x2 LCD Display – A liquid crystal display that shows characters in two rows.

Potentiometer – Adjusts the contrast of the LCD.

Breadboard and Connecting Wires – For circuit connections.


**How It Works**

**Wiring:** The LCD is connected to the Arduino in 4-bit mode using digital pins. A potentiometer is used for contrast adjustment.

**Code Execution:** The Arduino initializes the LCD and displays the "Hello, World!" message.

**Operation:** The display continuously shows the text as long as the circuit is powered.

**Steps to Build**
Gather the required components.

Connect the LCD display to the Arduino as per the circuit diagram.

Upload the provided Arduino code to your board.

Power the circuit and observe the "Completed Project" message on the LCD screen.
